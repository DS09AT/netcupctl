# STRICT configuration for public open-source project

[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# MINIMAL disable list - only Click framework incompatibilities
#
# too-many-arguments: Click decorators (@click.option, @click.argument)
#                     naturally add many parameters to command functions
#
# unused-argument: Click group functions receive 'ctx' via @pass_context
#                  decorators but may not use it directly
#
# too-few-public-methods: Click command groups are containers for
#                         subcommands, not traditional classes
#
# invalid-name: Click commands commonly use Python builtin names
#               like 'list', 'get', 'set' as function names
#
# unnecessary-pass: Click group functions use pass as placeholder body
#
# redefined-builtin: Click commands use names like 'list', 'format'
#
# too-many-positional-arguments: Click decorators add parameters
